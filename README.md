# HarvestHollowHaul

[Based on ZeroGwafa's Seren Tracker](https://github.com/ZeroGwafa/SerenTracker/tree/master)

For those of you who want to track the loot from Harvest Hollow, I reworked the Seren Tracker to work for several rewards obtained during this seasonal Halloween event.

It tracks the following: 
- Spoils received at Maize Maze
- Loot from spoils and clan goodie bags
- Items found when skilling throughout Gielinor

When the app detects spoils by reading the tooltip, it updates the Alt1 Toolbar with icons representing the detected type of spoils.
You can hover over these icons to see a descriptive text:

**Legend for spoils icons:**

## How to install - currently in beta, check link in [updates](#updates)

Go to [the app](https://exinferi.nl/apps/hhh) in your browser and click the link, or:

1. Go to the browser inside Alt1 toolkit
2. Visit `https://exinferi.nl/apps/hhh`
3. Hit the yellow 'add app' button in the upper right corner.

The app needs the following permissions: Pixel, Gamestate and Overlay.  
**Make sure to turn chatfilter off and turn timestamps on!**

Have fun tracking!

## Known issues  

* May behave odd with different chat sizes than 12.
* Reward history display is a bit funky when there's less than 25 items to display.

## Updates

**Update 17 Oct 2024, 17:30 Game Time**:

* Fixed double spooky token drops not being properly added together.
* Added an Alt1 toolbar message of which spoils it has detected (requires overlay permission).

**Update 16 Oct 2024, 20:00 Game Time**:

* **Breaking change**: Introduced source tracking for each individual type of spoils:
  * This works by tracking the tooltip when opening the bags with the mouse. So please, click the bags and don't keybind them ðŸ˜‡
  * The tracked source is being displayed on screen if overlay is enabled for the app. Don't open until you see this display, otherwise the source may be wrong!
  * You can check the data for the sources by using the right-click context-menu on the header:

* Fixed a lot of minor processing bux yesterday.

**Update 14 Oct 2024, 14:00 Game Time**:

* [Beta release!](https://exinferi.github.io/HarvestHollowHaul/)
