# WildyRewards

[Based on ZeroGwafa's Seren Tracker](https://github.com/ZeroGwafa/SerenTracker/tree/master)

For those of you who want to track the loot from Wilderness Flash Events, I reworked the Seren Tracker to work for the Sack of (very) wild rewards and Wyrm reward gland.

## How to install

Go to [the app](https://exinferi.nl/apps/wildy) in your browser and click the link, or:

1. Go to the browser inside Alt1 toolkit
2. Visit `https://exinferi.nl/apps/wildy`
3. Hit the yellow 'add app' button in the upper right corner.

**Make sure to turn chatfilter off and turn timestamps on!**

Have fun tracking!

## Known issues  

* May behave odd with size 10 chat.

## Updates

**Update 03 July 2024, 19:40 Game Time**:

* Release!
* The reward history only loads 25 items at a time to improve performance when a lot of rewards have been captured.
  * *Click the "load more" button at the bottom of the list to expand.*
* The top button can now be right clicked to quickly navigate rather than having to keep cycling with the left click.

  *Left click still works for cycling, though.*
