# ChristmasTracker

[Based on ZeroGwafa's Seren Tracker](https://github.com/ZeroGwafa/SerenTracker/tree/master)

For those of you who want to track the loot from Christmas presents, I reworked the Seren Tracker to work for Christmas presents obtained during the repeatable Christmas events.

## How to install

Go to [the app](https://exinferi.nl/apps/xmas) in your browser and click the link, or:

1. Go to the browser inside Alt1 toolkit
2. Visit `https://exinferi.nl/apps/xmas`
3. Hit the yellow 'add app' button in the upper right corner.

The app needs the following permissions: Pixel, Gamestate and Overlay.  
**Make sure to turn chatfilter off and turn timestamps on!**

Have fun tracking!

## Known issues  

* May behave odd with different chat sizes than 12.
* Reward history display is a bit funky when there's less than 25 items to display.
* When opened on multiple clients, the toolbar display on all clients shows the most recently detected present from the last used client.

## Updates
**Update 29 November 2024, 20:45 Game Time**:

* [Beta release!](https://exinferi.github.io/ChristmasTracker/)
  * Reworked HarvestHollowHaul to work for the soonâ„¢ christmas presents
  * Adjusted chat comparison for duplicates to hopefully work a bit faster
  * Obviously this beta does nothing at time of release, since the event hasn't started yet >.<
